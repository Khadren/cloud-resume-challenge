## Resume Format

Resume format should be clean, pertinent details quickly and easily read.

Harvard Resume Template is a solid format to start with. I would adapt it to meet current standards

    Education at bottom rather than top

    Start with Name and Contact block as a header, followed by work experience and then skills

    If suited to your experience a professional summary before work experience could be beneficial
